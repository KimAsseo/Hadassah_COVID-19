## Calculators for probability to be positive to COVID-19 based on specific symptoms, according to Karni, Klein et al (link to medrxiv)

*IMPORTANT! 

# Low probability does NOT mean that the patient does not have COVID-19! High probability means high probability for COVID-19. 

To use , please download one of the excel files and fill your answers in the box title "Answers" as instructed in the "Comments" column. In red you will get the probability, scaled from 0 to 100 percent.
Please change "Rate of positive tests" to number of positive COVID-19 patients divided by number of tested patients. currently set to 0.08 in Israel.

* calculator_basic_and_taste (to be used for people with **previous** olfactory impairment)
